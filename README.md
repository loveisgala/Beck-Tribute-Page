## General info
This project is a responsive website and my first repository. <br>
It is based on an exercise from https://www.freecodecamp.org/ 'Responsive Web Design Certification' section. <br>
The thematic is a 'tribute page' and I choose Beck because I think is an incredible artist. <br>
It contains some additional id's to follow the test guidelines. <br>
<br>
I made a design with a gradient background, some border radio details, and fonts from 'Google Fonts'. <br>
The order of the elements was made with Flexbox for mobile-view and Grid for web-view. <br>
I hope you like it :)
